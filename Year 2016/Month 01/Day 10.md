## Starting Python Course  
The course [CSE1309x Introduction to Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAx+CSE1309x+2016T1/info) started today. I plan to take this course.  

## Installing Python
Installed Python version 3.5.1 for Windows on my home computer. It was downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

I choose to update my PATH during the installation.
